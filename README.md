#frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

This is an awesome game, made as a project for th Udacity Frondend Nanodegree.

To start you should clone, fork or download th project on a local folder.

You can run it by opening the `index.html` file on the project folder or setting up a simple server to run on the same folder and run it in localhost. One way of doing this is with python 3(you should have python pre installed) with the command `python -m http.server [<portNo>]`.

Once you open the page with any of the previously mentioned optiones, the game will automatically start.

You should try to pass the enemies and get to the water line to increase your score. Game will get harder as you progress.

Enjoy it!
